# 🧮 Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python
# 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

# 🧠 Algorithm
Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable a (real part).
Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable b (imaginary part).
Create a complex number x using the complex(a, b) function.
Print the complex number x.
Print the real part of x using x.real.
Print the imaginary part of x using x.imag.
# 💻 Program
```
x=int(input(''))
y=int(input(''))
x=complex(x,y)
print(x)
print(x.real)
print(x.imag)
```
# Output
