# Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python
# ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False.

# ðŸ§  Algorithm
Set variable a to the result of the expression 0 == True.
Set variable b to the result of the expression False == False.
Set variable c to the result of the expression True + True.
Set variable d to the result of the expression False + 9.
Print the value of a with the label "a is".
Print the value of b with the label "b is".
Print the value of c with the label "c:".
Print the value of d with the label "d:".
# ðŸ’» Program
```
a = (0 == True)
b = (False== False)
c = True + True
d = False + 9
print('a is',a)
print('b is',b)
print('c:',c)
print('d:',d)
```
# Output
